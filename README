IMPORTANT:  This script is "AS-IS" and is a reflection of a script that I have used 
for the past few years. This is in no way a perfect script for upgrading every version
of StatusNet but more of an outline to get you a starting point.

For most standard instances, this script can work very efficiently for smaller
communities and has a number of limitations due to a variety of platforms and 
configurations that are possible. There are a number of things to keep in mind when
running this script:

1. This script DOES NOT backup or stop any running daemons so BACKUP, BACKUP, BACKUP!
   (you have been warned!!!)

2. READ the Upgrade section of the README on Status.Net's Gitorious site at:
   http://gitorious.org/statusnet/mainline/blobs/master/README
   
3. Although the tail of this script does in fact start the daemons for things like
   XMPP, Twitter Sync, etc, it does not stop them or kill any other dependants so 
   that should be done prior to running the script.
   
4. I am not a programmer by trade, although do a fair amount on many platforms, I 
   am hoping some in the community build and refine some of my methods here to 
   improve the flexibility.
   
5. Remember there is probably a reason StatusNet doesn't bother with trying to push
   out an upgrade tool since this is open and everyone, including myself, have 
   customized the install with plugins, themes and other tweaks to make it fit our 
   needs.



Summary of functions
====================

This script will perform the following once you have backed up, shut down web access,
and shut down all daemons running and writing to the site:

1. Downloads the new StatusNet tarball specified

2. Unpacks downloaded tarball

3. Removes tarball once unpacked

4. Copies all files necessary files from current instance (mublog folder)

5. Gives proper access to all write folders (avatar, file, background)

6. Stops daemons in scripts folder (/scripts/stopdaemons.sh)

7. Renames the old instance to mublog-(instance number)

8. Renames the new instance to mublog

9. Renames the htaccess.sample to .htaccess and rewrites the correct base (currently
   sets rewrite base to root '/')
   
10. Starts daemons back up (/scripts/startdaemons.sh)

11. Notifies that StatusNet has been upgraded from old to new version.



How to execute
==============

Currently it is run like any other script, make sure to make the script executable 
and run in the format of:

$./snupdate 

The script will run and prompt you for the current version that is installed and the
version you wish to install.  It will download and unpack the tarball and proceed with
with above procedure.

In the works
============

In order to add some flexibility to this script, I will be working on adding prompts
for specification for the install including the base folder and template paths.  
This works pretty well for most "out of the box" installs.
